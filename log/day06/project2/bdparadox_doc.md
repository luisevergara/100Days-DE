# Project Breakdown

1. **Define the Problem**: The goal of this project is to explore the "Birthday Paradox" - the surprising probability that in a group of N people, the odds that two of them have matching birthdays is surprisingly large. The program simulates random birthdays and displays the results.

2. **Break Down the Problem**: The program needs to:
   - Generate a list of random birthdays for a given number of people.
   - Determine if there are any matching birthdays in the list.
   - Run multiple simulations to calculate the probability of having matching birthdays.
   - Display the results to the user.

3. **Research and Gather Information**: The program uses the built-in `datetime` and `random` modules to generate and work with birthdays. The "Birthday Paradox" is a well-known statistical phenomenon that the program aims to explore.

4. **Plan and Design**: The program is divided into two main functions: `getBirthdays()` and `getMatch()`. The `getBirthdays()` function generates a list of random birthdays, while the `getMatch()` function checks if there are any matching birthdays in the list.

5. **Set up the Environment**: The program can be run in any Python environment. No additional setup is required.

6. **Define Functions and Classes**: The program defines two functions:
   - `getBirthdays(numberOfBirthdays)`: Returns a list of `numberOfBirthdays` random date objects for birthdays.
   - `getMatch(birthdays)`: Returns the date object of a birthday that occurs more than once in the `birthdays` list, or `None` if there are no matches.

7. **Implement Core Logic**: The core logic of the program is implemented in the main part of the code, where the program:
   - Prompts the user to enter the number of birthdays to generate (up to 100).
   - Generates the birthdays using the `getBirthdays()` function.
   - Checks for matching birthdays using the `getMatch()` function.
   - Displays the results to the user.
   - Runs 100,000 simulations to calculate the probability of having matching birthdays.

8. **Test and Debug**: The program has been tested to ensure that it generates random birthdays correctly, correctly identifies matching birthdays, and displays the results accurately.

9. **Refactor and Optimize**: The program is straightforward and efficient, and no further optimization is necessary.

10. **Document Your Code**: The code includes docstrings for the two functions, as well as comments throughout the program to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.

11. **Test Thoroughly**: The program has been thoroughly tested by running it with various input sizes and verifying the correctness of the output.

12. **Handle Errors and Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where the user enters an invalid number of birthdays (outside the range of 1 to 100) by prompting the user to enter a valid number.

13. **Add User Interface (Optional)**: The program has a simple command-line interface, where the user is prompted to enter the number of birthdays to generate.

14. **Deploy and Distribute**: The program can be distributed as a standalone Python script that can be run on any system with Python installed.

15. **Maintain and Update**: The program is a self-contained simulation and does not require ongoing maintenance or updates.
