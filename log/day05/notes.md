# Day 05

*Programming*ðŸ«¡

## Lessons Learned

- Learn to start projects using The Big Book of Small Python Projects.
- This are the concepts that we will practice on Day05 using Python.
- The importance of pseudocode when writing applications when you are starting out building your programming logic.

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
   - Understanding their creation, manipulation, and practical use cases
   - Comprehensions (list, dictionary, and set comprehensions)

2. **Control Flow**:
   - Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
   - Looping constructs (for, while)
   - Breaking and continuing loops
   - Handling exceptions (try, except, finally)

3. **Functions**:
   - Defining and calling functions
   - Passing arguments (positional, keyword, and default arguments)
   - Return values
   - Lambda functions (anonymous functions)

4. **Modules and Packages**:
   - Importing modules and packages
   - Understanding the Python standard library
   - Installing and using third-party packages (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

5. **File Handling**:
   - Reading and writing files
   - Working with different file formats (text, CSV, JSON, etc.)
   - File operations (open, read, write, append, close)

6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Classes and objects
   - Attributes and methods
   - Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
   - Special methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`)

7. **Decorators**:
   - Understanding decorators and their syntax
   - Using built-in decorators (e.g., `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`)
   - Creating custom decorators

8. **Generators and Iterators**:
   - Generator functions and expressions
   - The `yield` keyword
   - Iterator protocol and iteration tools

9. **Error Handling and Debugging**:
   - Raising and catching exceptions
   - Using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` clauses
   - Debugging techniques (e.g., print statements, debugger, logging)

10. **Functional Programming**:
    - Higher-order functions (functions that accept or return other functions)
    - Concepts like map, filter, and reduce
    - Lambda functions and their applications

11. **Modules for Data Analysis and Manipulation**:
    - NumPy (numerical computing)
    - Pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
    - Matplotlib (data visualization)

12. **File I/O and Data Formats**:
    - Reading and writing CSV, JSON, and other data formats
    - Working with databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)

13. **Regular Expressions**:
    - Understanding regular expression syntax
    - Using the `re` module for pattern matching and text manipulation

14. **Web Development**:
    - Understanding HTTP concepts
    - Working with web frameworks like Flask or Django

15. **Testing and Debugging**:
    - Unit testing with unittest or pytest
    - Writing testable code
    - Debugging techniques and tools
