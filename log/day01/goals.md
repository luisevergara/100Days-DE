# Commitment PlanðŸŽ¯

I hope to understand the full Data Engineering Life Cycle in theory and in practice. 

This is my current starting point *(Basic Level)*:
- Python
- SQL
- Power BI
- Linux
- Git
- Docker

## Accountability

I won't be doing 100 days straight of Data Engineering, but I have in place a Accountability Partner System that will check my progress from time to time.

For a day to be considered finished, the folder must contain:
- Lessons Learned Notes
- Practice Code Samples
- Any Homework or Assignment Completed
- Questions and Answers Notes

**AVERAGE: 3 days per week**  
*This will depend heavily on my other priorities*

When reaching certain milestones, I would like to post on Linkedin to start generating interest from potential employers for a break-in to the Data Engineering Field.

## Aditional Information

Even though the focus of this proyect is to learn the concepts and application of Data Engineering Technology, I would like to incorporate some basic Machine Learning and AI due to the importance of understanding the whole landscape in a Data Environment.
